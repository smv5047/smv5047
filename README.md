<h1>Hi, I'm Steve Vandenburg:wave:</h1>

I'm a Dad, DJ, and Developer. As a Full-Stack Developer I've built projects using React, Node, Vanilla JS, and Python. I have extensive project management experience across enterprises large and small. From public companies to startups I've worked with cross-functional teams to deliver security and IT projects timely and on budget. I'm looking forward to my next challenge as a Developer.

<h2>Why I'm a Developer</h2>

* Craftsmanship
* Leverage
* Enjoyment
* Attack Big Problems
* Remote Work
