<h1>:wave: Hi, I'm Steve Vandenburg</h1>

I'm a Dad, Defender, DJ, and Developer. As a Full-Stack Developer I've built projects using React, NodeJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Python. I have extensive project management experience across enterprises large and small. From public companies to startups I've worked with cross-functional teams to deliver security and technology projects timely and on budget.
